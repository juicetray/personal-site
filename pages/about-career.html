          Currently, I've been working in a Customer Operations Specialist role that deals in Trust & Safety for around 2 years. In this role, I've provided support to our client
          to resolve escalated items and tickets while doing some escalation myself. Furthermore, I've routinely met the KPIs that were set and earned privileges such
          as employee of the month and opportunity to speak directly to the client and work on tasks with them. Though not directly related to my Digital Media degree,
          it has woken me up to the side of customer and technical support that I'd always noticed but never thought too deeply about.

          The environment is very collaborative and fast-paced while allowing me to maintain independence. Throughout school, I was never one to jump for joy when there 
          was a group assignment or I had to do public speaking. However, during my final year at college and my 2 years as a Customer Operations Specialist, I've found 
          myself enjoying that part of my work.

        <p class="sub-header-text">
          I've always been interested in art, which spurned me to make this web
          app. The whole gist behind it is quite simple: guess the names of the
          famous paintings. You can receive hints in the forms of the artist's
          name and the year it was made. Making it was quite fun since it was
          something I actually cared about and hadn't seen many examples of
          online. I also got the opportunity to make my own API, mainly because
          the Chicago Museum of Art's API wasn't being very cooperative!

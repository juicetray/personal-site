        <h2 class="sub-header">Painting Guessing Game & Painting API</h2>
        <p class="sub-header-text">
          This project started as a simple interactive quiz where users guessed
          the names of famous paintings. Hints included the artist's name and
          the year the painting was made. It began with a static single-page
          layout and no user accounts, using hard-coded quiz data and basic CSS
          styling. I also created a custom API to serve painting data, as the
          Chicago Museum of Art's API didn't meet my needs.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-header-text">
          Since then, I've significantly revamped the project to include:
          <ul>
            <li>Background textures for a more engaging visual experience.</li>
            <li>Additional pages with consistent styling and improved navigation.</li>
            <li>
              A Node.js-based <strong>login and registration system</strong> that uses Supabase to securely manage user accounts, enabling features like future score tracking and leaderboard integration.
            </li>
            <li>Modularized CSS for easier maintenance and scalability. I'm trying to get into the habit of building things as components/systems for reusability, as
              one of the most tiresome parts about building side projects is making the same UI components over and over and not getting to the actual creative/interesting
              part of the project.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="sub-header-text">
          Planned features include:
          <ul>
            <li><s>Lightbulb hint icon to help users during the quiz.</s>✅</li>
            <li><s>Designing a custom logo for consistent branding.</s>✅</li>
            <li><s>Revamping the quiz section for better UI/UX.</s>✅</li>
            <li><s>Implementing a leaderboard and score tracking for competitiveness and engagement.</s>✅</li>
            <li><s>Expanding the painting library for a richer quiz experience.</s>✅</li>
            <li><s>Set up a project for the site in Jira to better track tasks and list them out.</s>✅</li>
            <li>Adding an information section explaining game rules, credits, and details about the API.</li>
          </ul>

        <p class="sub-header-text">
          Politizen is a mobile app designed to help people better understand, track, and participate in their local government.
           Built using React Native, it was a two semester-long group project where I served as a developer and also contributed 
           heavily to the design and user experience planning.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-header-text">
          From the early stages of ideation and wireframing to final deployment, I worked alongside a team of five other students 
          to bring Politizen to life. Our goal was to create a clean, intuitive interface where users could view local election 
          information, track legislation, and explore ways to take action on issues that matter to them.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-header-text">
          As the lead developer, I managed the codebase, helped implement core features, and ensured that our development workflow 
          stayed on track. I also contributed to the design system, working on layouts, navigation, and UI patterns to make the app 
          feel polished and accessible.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-header-text">
            At the time, I decided to suggest React Native as I'd never done mobile development before. The class I had on it wasn't
            very fulfilling and I didn't feel like I gained much from it. Following that thought process, challenging myself to use
            it for my capstone project felt like a good idea. The experience was very rewarding as the most I'd done "mobile development"-wise
            at the time was mobile-first web design.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-header-text">
            Outside of choosing React Native, the entire process of planning the application and eventually developing it showed me
            that plans change frequently during a development cycle. For example, we had no plans to use Firebase originally but our
            original selection ended up not being compatible with what we were aiming for.

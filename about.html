          This is the obligatory "About Me" that every portfolio seems to have.
          I've always thought it was funny that those sections never really told
          you about the person themselves, just their marketable skills.

          So, me. Justice Anderson. At the time of me writing this, I don't have
          much to say about myself in particular. As stated in the ultra quick
          version of this, my main hobbies are listening to music and watching
          basketball. I also left out a reading hobby of mine, but that's been
          on the backburner a little due to my work schedule.
